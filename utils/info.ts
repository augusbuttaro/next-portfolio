    description: 'Hi! I’m Augusto Buttaro, a 22-year-old Full-Stack Developer from Argentina, currently pursuing a 2nd year in Computer/Software Engineering (Ingeniería Informática). With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I specialize in creating dynamic web applications. My expertise includes technologies such as React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, Tailwind CSS and more! I’ve successfully developed projects such as an E-Commerce platform with complex payment integrations and a College Dashboard for managing class schedules and to-dos. Coding is something that I love and pushes me to grow and learn more everyday. I am quite creative and really enjoy letting my imagination fly at the time of building something. Outside of programming, I enjoy basketball, video games, and music. I’m always eager to tackle new challenges and expand my horizons.',
